## Machine Learning Course Projects

This README document provides an overview of the projects I completed during my machine learning course. The projects covered a range of topics and techniques, providing hands-on experience with various machine learning algorithms and tools.

### 1. Object Recognition with Keras API

In this project, I utilized the Keras API to develop an object recognition system. The key components of this project included:

- **Data Preparation**: Preprocessing images and organizing datasets.
- **Model Architecture**: Fine-tunning and implementing a Visual Transformer network (VIT) using Keras.
- **Training**: Training the CNN on the dataset and using techniques like data augmentation to improve performance.
- **Evaluation**: Assessing the model's accuracy and fine-tuning hyperparameters to optimize results.
- **Deployment**: Creating a script to load the trained model and make predictions on new images.

### 2. Lasso and Linear Regressions

This project focused on understanding and implementing regression techniques. Key aspects included:

- **Linear Regression**: Implementing a simple linear regression model and understanding its assumptions and limitations.
- **Lasso Regression**: Applying lasso regression to introduce regularization and prevent overfitting.
- **Comparison**: Comparing the performance of linear and lasso regressions on various datasets.
- **Visualization**: Plotting results to visualize the fit and the effect of regularization.

### 3. Random Forest

In this project, I explored the Random Forest algorithm for classification and regression tasks. The project involved:

- **Data Preparation**: Cleaning and preparing the dataset for use with the Random Forest algorithm.
- **Model Implementation**: Implementing the Random Forest algorithm and training it on the dataset.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Using techniques such as grid search to find the best hyperparameters for the model.
- **Evaluation**: Evaluating the model's performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- **Feature Importance**: Analyzing the importance of different features in making predictions.

### 4. Fine-Tuning Models

This project involved fine-tuning pre-trained models to improve performance on specific tasks. Key activities included:

- **Transfer Learning**: Utilizing pre-trained models and adapting them to new datasets.
